# ReqExec - Shippable build executor

[![Run Status](https://api.shippable.com/projects/59e069c1f7ca690700e9274f/badge?branch=master)](https://app.shippable.com/github/Shippable/reqExec)

`reqExec` is the component on the build node that executes the build steps.
Once [reqKick](https://github.com/shippable/reqKick) decides to run a build
step, it either

    - call `reqExec` directly to run build on the host, or
    - spins up a `reqExec` mounted Docker container that runs the build in the container
Unlike [reqProck](https://github.com/shippable/reqProc) and [reqKick](https://github.com/shippable/reqKick),
`reqExec` is not an always-running agent, but a single platform-specific compiled binary that is responsible
for following tasks:

- run the `bash` scripts that contain the build step commands
- publish logs from running the script
- return the steps status back to [reqKick](https://github.com/shippable/reqKick)

It is one of the three components that are installed on the host when users [initialize](http://docs.shippable.com/platform/runtime/nodes/#byon-nodes) the host to act as a build node on Shippable. The other two components that are installed upon node initialization are [reqProc](https://github.com/shippable/reqProc)
and [reqKick](https://github.com/shippable/reqKick).
